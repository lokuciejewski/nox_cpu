#### CPU components

### Registers
 - Two hardware 8-bit stack registers `A` and `B` supporting `push`, `pop` and `peek` operations.
 - Two hardware counter/index 8-bit registers `HI` and `LI` supporting `zero`, `load` and `store` operations.
 - `A` and `B` can be treated as one 16-bit stack register.
 - `HI` and `LI` can be treated as one 16-bit counter/index register.
